        <blockquote>I was struggling to lose weight after the birth of my second child. My friend recommended NewYou,
            and
            after the first three months I had lost 30 pounds. Thanks to the personal attention from their trainers and
            counselors, I’ve been able to keep the weight off for two years. I’m in the best shape of my life!
